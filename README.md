### *Project 3. Building a Data Mart for Demand Forecasting in an automotive company*
* **Overview:**
An automotive company wants to perform demand forecasting to better understand the expected demand in future periods. Based on historic data, demand forecasting for future period is performed. The forecasts will be sales forecasts that are used in sales planning and in demand forecasts, which, in turn, are used to ensure thatthe demanded number of products is available at the point of sale where thay are required. Forecast accuracy is important as over-forecasting results in costly inventory accumulation while under-forecasting results in missed sales opportunities.

* **Questions of interest:**
    + On a monthly basis, create a forecast for the next 12 months. This is done for items that have a long data history and for items that have a short data history
    + Identify the effect of events over time like sales promotions or price changes
    + Identify the correlation between item characteristics like price, size, or product group and the sales quantity in the respective calendar month
    + Identify seasonal patterns in the different product groups
