## **Capstone Project Ideas**

### *Project 1. Simona Halep  - patterns of play in tennis*

Simona Halep is a romanian tennis player that had a rapid rise in the rankings in the last 3 years ( 2012 - Top 50 Players, 2013 - No. 11, 2014 - No. 3, 2015 -No. 2). As tennis is a game of patterns, the scope of this project is to make an analysis of the way Simona Halep has changed her game from a lower ranked player to a Top 5 competitor.
