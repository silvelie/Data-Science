# Patterns of play in women's tennis
## Simona Halep


Simona Halep is a Romanian tennis player that had a rapid rise in the rankings in the last 3 years ( 2012 - Top 50 Player, 2013 - No. 11, 2014 - No. 3, 2015 - No. 2). As tennis is a game of patterns, the goal of this project is to make an analysis of the way Simona Halep has changed her game from a lower ranked player to a Top 5 competitor. The beginning of 2016 finds her at a crossroads. Currently at number 5 in the WTA rankings, having to overcome a series of nagging injuries that did not allow her to perform at the usual capacity, the romanian player tries to regain confidence and compete again at the highest level.
