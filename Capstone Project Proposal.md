## **Simona Halep  - patterns of play in women's tennis**

 
### **Overview:** 

Simona Halep is a Romanian tennis player that had a rapid rise in the rankings in the last 3 years ( 2012 - Top 50 Player, 2013 - No. 11, 2014 - No. 3, 2015 - No. 2). As tennis is a game of patterns, the goal of this project is to make an analysis of the way Simona Halep has changed her game from a lower ranked player to a Top 5 competitor.
The beginning of 2016 finds her at a crossroads. Currently at number 5 in the WTA rankings, having to overcome a series of nagging injuries that did not allow her to perform at the usual capacity, the romanian player tries to regain confidence and compete again at the highest level.

### 1. Problem to solve

Does she have the game to compete with the best on regular basis and if not, what does she have to do in order to maintain herself in the top?

   
### 2. Target audience

The analysis can be published on tennis sites as "Patterns of Play" tutorials. The information can be of good use for tennis commentators or coaches.
    
### 3. Data

The dataset available on GitHub from Jeff Sackmann "The Match Charting Project". CSV files with detailed shot-by-shot stats.

### 4. Aproach

Questions of interest:
    
+ Did the serve changed? How did the percentages of first and second serves changed in the course of the last three years?
    
+ Did she changed strategies? Which strategies are most successful?
    
+ What are her most succesful tournaments and surfaces?
    
+ What is her most frequent type of winning shot and most common error? How shots varies per unforced error/winner/forced error?

### 5. Deliverables

A story about tennis with data vizualizations in a ready to publish format.
