**Simona Halep  - patterns of play in women's tennis**

 
**Overview:** 

Simona Halep is a Romanian tennis player that had a rapid rise in the rankings in the last 3 years ( 2012 - Top 50 Player, 2013 - No. 11, 2014 - No. 3, 2015 - No. 2). As tennis is a game of patterns, the goal of this project is to make an analysis of the way Simona Halep has changed her game from a lower ranked player to a Top 5 competitor.
The beginning of 2016 finds her at a crossroads. Currently at number 7 in the WTA rankings, having to overcome a series of nagging injuries that did not allow her to perform at the usual capacity, the romanian player has to regain confidence and believe that she is one of the best.

**Questions of interest:**
    
+ Did the serve changed?
    
+ Did she changed strategies?
    
+ What are her most succesful tournaments and surfaces?
    
+ What is her best shot? 
   
+ Does she has the game to compete with the best on regular basis and if not, what does she has to do in order to maintain herself in the top?
