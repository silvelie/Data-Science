*Simona Halep  - patterns of play in women's tennis*

 
**Overview:** 

Simona Halep is a Romanian tennis player that had a rapid rise in the rankings in the last 3 years ( 2012 - Top 50 Player, 2013 - No. 11, 2014 - No. 3, 2015 - No. 2). As tennis is a game of patterns, the goal of this project is to make an analysis of the way Simona Halep has changed her game from a lower ranked player to a Top 5 competitor.

**Questions of interest:**
    
+ Did the serve changed?
    
+ Did she changed strategies?
    
+ What are her most succesful tournaments and surfaces?
    
+ What is her best shot? 
   
+ Does she has the game to compete with the best on regular basis and if not, what does she has to do in order to maintain herself in the top?
